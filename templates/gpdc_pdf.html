          <h4><b>Interpretation</b></h4>
          {% if pred == 'Erosion'%}
          <p>Gastric erosions are spots of damage on the lining of the stomach. It occurs when the mucous membrane lining the stomach becomes inflamed. The lining should be able to protect itself from acid of the stomach. Injury or illness makes it hard for the lining to work as it should. This can lead to the erosions.</p>
          {% elif pred == 'Polyp'%}
          <p>Gastric polyps are abnormal growths on the inner lining of your stomach. Most are harmless and donâ€™t cause symptoms. But some of them turn into cancer.There are many types of gastric polyps. They happen for different reasons. Some have little or no risk of becoming cancer. Others have a higher risk of turning into cancer.There are many types of gastric polyps. They happen for different reasons. Some have little or no risk of becoming cancer. Others have a higher risk of turning into cancer.</p>
          {% elif pred == 'Ulcer'%}
          <p>A gastric ulcer is a disintegration of the stomach lining which interferes with the production of the mucous that coats the lining allowing stomach acid to come in contact with the stomach. This causes pain to the patient after eating, which encourages the production of stomach acid.</p>
